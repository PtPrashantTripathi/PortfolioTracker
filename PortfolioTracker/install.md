### Step to Install the Package Locally

To use the modules from your `PortfolioTracker` package in your Jupyter notebooks, you need to install the package. You can do this by running the following command from the root of your project directory (where the `pyproject.toml` file is located):

```bash
pip install -e .
```

The `-e` flag (editable mode) allows you to make changes to the source code and have them reflected immediately without reinstalling the package.
